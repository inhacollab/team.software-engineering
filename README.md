# Team Software Engineering Project

This project demonstrates working with JSON data in Python. It includes a script to parse a JSON file and extract specific information.

## Files

- **parsejson.py**: A Python script that reads a JSON file and prints the `access_token` and its expiration time.
- **data/myfile_12225252.json**: A sample JSON file containing token information.

## Usage

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Place the JSON file in the `data` directory.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 parsejson.py
   ```
4. The script will output the `access_token` and its expiration time.

## Notes

- Update the file path in `parsejson.py` if the JSON file is located elsewhere.
- Ensure the JSON file follows the expected structure for the script to work correctly.
